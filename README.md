This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

App: Performs search through GitHub repositories. Allows to see list of contributers on separate route with pagination.

Steps to start:
1. Run "yarn" to install dependencies
2. Run "yarn start" to start the app

What was done/not done:

1. Used REST github api for not to use secret token with GraphQL
2. Used simplified pagination functionality. No "Link" header parsing used for pagination links retrieval.
3. All requirements are fulfilled.
4. Used react-material-ui for simple components styling.
5. No unit tests applied.
